                <li>
                    <h3>I locked my choices but now I would like to make further changes to my choice list. Is that allowed? If yes, how can I exercise the option?</h3>
                    <p><b><i>Answer:</i> </b><b>YES.</b>If you wish to edit your choices after locking but before the choice filing deadline, you can do so by first submitting a request to unlock in the online JoSAA portal.</p>
                    <h3>2). Choice filling deadline is already over. Am I allowed to make any changes in my choice list at this point?</h3>
                    <p><b><i>Answer:</i> </b>NO. You will not be allowed to edit your choice list after the deadline for choice filling, i.e. you cannot change the order of your choices OR add any more course in OR delete any course from the choice lisNo need for worries because your choices will automatically be locked after the deadline for choice filling.t after the deadline for choice filling.</p>
                    <h3>3)In the event that I forget to lock my choices on the JOSAA portal, will I still be eligible for the allotment process?</h3>
                    <p><b><i>Answer:</i> </b> There's no need to worry about forgetting to lock your choices on the JOSAA portal because they will be automatically locked once the choice filing deadline has passed. </p>
                    <h3>4) What are the steps to be followed after being allotted a seat through the JOSAA portal?</h3>
                    <p><b><i>Answer:</i> </b>If you are allocated a seat in a certain round of JoSAA, you need to follow steps for online reporting that include (i) acceptance of the seat, (ii) uploading of documents and (iii) payment of seat acceptance fee.If you fail to follow any of the steps you cannot go for further rounds of allotment.</p>
                    <h3>5)What are FLOAT, SLIDE , FREEZE options in the allotment process ?</h3>
                    <p><b><i>Answer:</i> </b> These options appear after you got allotted in any of the rounds rather than last round i.e. Round 6</p>
                    <p><b>FLOAT</b> : This option helps you to participate in further rounds of allotment and will consider all the upper options and the options(choices) below the allotted choice will be deleted automatically.</p>
                    <p><b>SLIDE</b>  – When a candidate chooses the 'Slide' option, it means that they have accepted the offered seat but if an admission is offered to an academic program of higher preference in the 'same institute,' they will accept it in subsequent rounds of JoSAA Counseling.</p>
                    <p><b>FREEZE </b>- Candidate choosing Freeze agrees and accepts the offered seat and also agrees that he/she would not participate in the counseling anymore. It is a final 'lock' on the seat offered and once freeze is accepted, the seat is provisionally allotted to the candidate</p>

                    <p><b><i>Answer:</i> </b> Once you have chosen the "freeze" option, you will not be eligible to participate in any subsequent rounds. If you select "freeze," you will be allotted a seat, and you will need to pay the seat acceptance fee and complete any additional required procedures to confirm your seat.</p>
                    <h3>7)  I have been allocated a seat in JoSAA for the first time. I have accepted the seat, uploaded the documents and chosen my willingness, but I have not yet paid my fees for an allocated seat. Will the allocated seat be confirmed to me by the reporting officials?</h3>

                        <p><b><i>Answer:</i> </b> You MUST pay the seat acceptance fee and complete all the steps of the online 
                        reporting process in the same round of seat allocation for continuing with the JoSAAprocess to avail the seat in IITs or NITs system. Your allocated seat will be 
                        CANCELED and you will no longer be able to participate in the subsequent rounds of seat allocation process (if any) if you do not complete all the steps of online reporting process including the payment of seat acceptance fee.</p>

                 <p><b><i>Answer:</i> </b>No, if you have already completed all the steps of online reporting process in a certain round in reporting center of NIT+system and you have been allocated another seat of higher preference in your choice list in another Institute of NIT+system, you don’t have to repeat the online reporting process.</p>
                    <h3>10) I was NOT allocated a seat during the first 5 Rounds of JoSAA. However, I got allocated a seat in an IIT in the 6th Round of JoSAA. If I do not join the allocated seat, am I eligible to appear for JEE Advanced next year?
                    </h3>
                    <p><b><i>Answer:</i> </b>If you are allocated a seat in an IIT for the first time in the 6th round of JoSAA, you need to either complete the online reporting process of JoSAA or report to the admitting Institute (including payment of seat acceptance fee) to confirm your seat. If you do not complete the reporting process, you will be eligible for appearing in JEE (Advanced) in the subsequent year provided you meet all other eligibility requirements.</p>

                    </h3>  
                    <p> <b><i>Answer:</i> </b> Filling-in of choices on the online portal is free of cost, i.e. candidates are NOT required to pay any fee.

                 <h3>13)What happens if the student fails to respond to the queries ?
                </h3>
                <p><b><i>Answer:</i> </b> Respond to queries (if any) At the time of document verification, if the document verification officer raises any query, the candidate must respond in online mode (through candidate portal) within the stipulated time. Failure to respond to the query(ies) on time will lead to cancellation of the allotted seat and the candidate will no longer be able to participate in the JoSAA 2023 process. It is the responsibility of the candidate to check the online portal at regular intervals of time and respond to queries (if any) without fail within the stipulated time.
